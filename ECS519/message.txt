Here are the instructions for CW-3. 

• You should form groups of up to 5 students. You can keep your CW-2 group, form an entirely new group, or you may also choose to work on your own.  We ask you to form the new groups by the end of next week (week 10), using the same procedure as for CW-2. 

• You will be able to submit CW-3 anytime between 12 December at 12:00 and 16 December at 12:00. This is a firm deadline. 

• CW-3 is intended to build on CW-2 and use the schema that you developed with your group. The feedback you got from the demonstrators should help you finalize a good schema. 
• However, should you wish not to use the schema you have worked on, a ready-made schema will be made available on QMPlus. Note that it will come without any explanations and you will need to work out the kind of data it is intended for.

• CW-3 consists of 4 parts:
	- Part 1: Database creation. Based on the schema you choose, we ask you to create a minimum of 5 tables using SQL CREATE commands.
	We expect to see constraints (e.g. key constraints) being used, we also expect to see an instance of Generalisation  (2 MARKS).
	You should then populate your tables with at least 10 rows of data per table using SQL INSERT statements (2 MARKS).
	- Part 2: Basic queries. Write 2 basic but non-trivial SQL queries using dates, joins or functions. SELECT * FROM table will not be accepted. Example: customers who booked a room whose price is greater than 200 (2 MARKS).
	- Part 3: Medium queries. Write 3 (2 if you're working alone) medium queries using group-by and complex joins (self-joins, outer joins). Example: customers who booked a comfort room and a luxury room, all rooms with the customers who booked them including the rooms no customer has booked (3 MARKS).
	- Part 4: Advanced queries. Write 3 (2 if you're working alone) advanced queries using nested queries, set-based conditions or aggregations. Example: show customers who booked more rooms than the average customer (i.e. the average number of rooms), all customers who booked mostly luxury rooms (e.g. more than 90% of the bookings were for luxury rooms) (6 MARKS).

• You will submit your SQL script in a .sql file. The SQL script MUST work without ANY issues on either MySQL or LiveSQL (specify as a comment at the top of the file). If the script does not run, but the demonstrators finds a way to make it run within 3 minutes, marks will be discounted by 50%. It it does not work, you will get at most 30% of the marks.
