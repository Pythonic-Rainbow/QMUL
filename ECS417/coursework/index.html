                        Got interested in computers because my first laptop couldn't handle games well. 
                        I started researching factors impacting a system's performance and ultimately 
                        built my own computer at 17.

                    <p>
                        I taught myself Python because I wanted to make a bot on Discord. However, with no prior coding experience, 
                        the code quickly became a mess. That didn't stop me because I was fascinated at how programs would behave 
                        when we write code, and so I would search on Google hundreds of time everyday. I've had rewritten the bot 
                        multiple times, but with each rewrite I felt like I've learnt a lot. I eventually learnt multiple programming 
                        languages with the help of Google and many other online resources.
